# UI/UX Research: Basys Processing

## **Description of Business**

Basys Processing is a payment processing company founded in 2002 and headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland. The company provides a wide range of payment processing services to businesses of all sizes, including credit and debit card processing, electronic check processing, online payment processing, and mobile payment processing. Basys Processing's payment processing solutions are designed to be easy to use and customizable to fit the unique needs of each business. The company offers a variety of tools and solutions to help businesses manage their payment processing, such as virtual terminals, fraud prevention tools, and recurring billing options.

## **Research Problem**

Basys Processing faces difficulties in satisfying clients, specifically in the long-term satisfaction branch. The company has continued to grow rapidly due to the exponential growth of new clients but continues to face short relationships with 19.4 percent of all lifetime clients.

## **Research Methods Used in Study**

I conducted a mixed-methods study, comprising both quantitative and qualitative research methods. I first conducted a survey with 200 current clients of the payment processing company to assess their level of satisfaction with the current customizability options. Next, I conducted in-depth interviews with 20 clients who expressed dissatisfaction with the current customizability options to understand their pain points and needs. Finally, I analyzed the survey and interview data to draw conclusions and recommendations.

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

The survey results indicated that while the payment processing company offers some customizability options, clients feel limited in their ability to tailor the product to their specific needs. Specifically, clients expressed a need for more control over pricing, user interface, and transaction features. The in-depth interviews further revealed that clients often feel constrained by the limited options and struggle to differentiate their product from competitors due to a lack of customizability. Clients also expressed a desire for more flexibility in terms of pricing and contract terms, as they felt that the current options were too rigid.

Based on the survey and interview findings, it is clear that the payment processing company needs to offer more customizability options to meet the needs of its clients. By allowing clients to have greater control over the pricing, user interface, and transaction features, the company can better differentiate itself from competitors and increase client satisfaction. Additionally, offering more flexible pricing and contract terms can attract new clients who are seeking more adaptable payment solutions. Overall, enhancing customizability can help the payment processing company improve its product fit and better serve the needs of its clients.

### **Proposed Strategic Plan**

To address the identified need for more control and customizability, the following strategic plan is proposed:

1. **Enhance Customization Options**:
   - Conduct a comprehensive review of current customization options and identify areas for improvement.
   - Implement new features such as custom branding options and more flexible payment options to provide clients with greater control over the look and feel of their payment pages.
   - Develop a user-friendly interface that will make it easier for clients to access and use these features.

2. **Improve Reporting and Analytics Features**:
   - Conduct a thorough needs analysis to identify the specific reporting and analytics features our clients need.
   - Develop and implement more advanced reporting and analytics tools to provide clients with greater control over their payments and improve their ability to track and manage payments more easily.

3. **Provide Enhanced Customer Support and Resources**:
   - Increase our customer support team to ensure clients have access to knowledgeable representatives who can help them better utilize the new features.
   - Create a comprehensive help center with step-by-step guides and tutorials that explain how to use the new features and customization options.
   - Launch a series of webinars and other training resources to educate clients on the benefits and potential use cases for the new features and customization options.
